🟥 ENGINEER WORK LOG — Sprint Week 1, Day 2

Date: February 12, 2026
Focus: Profile in Dashboard – Read-Only Display

🎯 Objective

Enable users to view their profile data directly in the Dashboard.
No editing functionality (edit comes Day 3).

✅ Features Implemented

Added Profile access in Dashboard header (anchor navigation).

Implemented compact Profile Peek Card under Goals section.

Card fetches data from GET /api/profile/get.

Supports:

Loading state

Error state

Defensive “No profile yet” state

Displays:

Rider weight

Bike weight

CdA

Crr

Crank efficiency

Bike type

Tire width

Tire quality

FTP (shows “Not set” if null)

Profile version number

Desktop: hover reveals details

Mobile: tap reveals details

Styling aligned with existing Dashboard aesthetic (rounded glass cards, shadow depth, spacing consistency)

🧱 Architectural Notes

/profile route remains edit/settings page.

Dashboard Profile card is strictly read-only.

profile.json remains SSOT.

No backend changes made.

No data structure modifications.

No impact on Strava, rides, or analysis pipeline.

Clear separation maintained:
Settings (write) → API → Dashboard (read).

🧪 Testing Performed

Verified profile renders correctly for existing user.

Confirmed proper handling of null values (FTP → “Not set”).

Confirmed no console errors.

Verified anchor navigation scrolls correctly.

Confirmed responsive behavior (hover desktop / tap mobile).

Defensive fallback for missing profile in place (though onboarding currently guarantees existence).

🎨 UX Refinement

Instead of large static profile block:

Implemented compact, contextual card.

Keeps dashboard hierarchy intact.

Avoids visual disruption of main value flow.

Preserves professional presentation.
