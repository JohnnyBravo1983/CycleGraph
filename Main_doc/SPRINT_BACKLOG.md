# CycleGraph – Sprint Backlog (Feb 11 - Mar 1, 2026)
**Sprint Goal:** Launch Pioneer Beta with stable profile system and power analytics  
**Duration:** 18 days  
**End Date:** March 1, 2026

---

## 🎯 Sprint Objectives

**Must-Have (March 1):**
- ✅ Users can signup with complete profile (gender, country, city, age)
- ✅ Onboarding is clean and understandable
- ✅ Users can view and edit profile in Dashboard
- ✅ Profile versioning works (weight changes don't affect old rides)
- ✅ **Users can import 10 or 50 rides (50 is default/recommended)**
- ✅ **Power Profile shows FTP + peak efforts (1, 5, 20, 60min)**
- ✅ **FTP Progression shows trend and future projection**

**Success Metrics:**
- 10-20 pioneer users can test
- System is stable and deterministic
- No critical bugs
- Presentable for job applications
- **WOW factor: Users see their form + progression immediately after import**

---

## 📥 Import Strategy (Pioneer Beta)

**CRITICAL DECISION: Keep it simple**

For Pioneer Beta, users can import ONLY:
- **50 rides** (default/recommended) - Full Power Profile + meaningful FTP Progression
- **10 rides** (quick test) - Basic Power Profile, limited progression data

**Why not more options (25, 100, date ranges)?**
- Simpler UX (less decisions = faster onboarding)
- 50 rides is sweet spot: Enough data for trends, not overwhelming
- 10 rides lets users "test drive" before committing
- Can add more options in April if users request it

**Implementation in Day 8:**
- Simple dropdown: "Import 10 rides" or "Import 50 rides"
- Default selection: 50 rides
- Help text: "50 rides recommended for full analytics"

Day 4 - Friday, Feb 14 🔴

Focus: Profile & Onboarding UI alignment + Dashboard simplification

Tasks:

Unify Profile UI:

Move current Profile layout/design from Dashboard into Profile Settings page

Ensure Profile Settings becomes the single source of truth for editing all profile values

Align onboarding form layout with Profile Settings (same visual language, spacing, structure)

Improve layout & clarity:

Add more spacing and cleaner grouping of fields

Group fields logically (Rider, Bike, Aero, Advanced)

Mark required vs optional fields clearly

Add tooltips/help text for technical fields:

CdA: "Aerodynamic drag (0.250–0.350, lower = faster)"

Crr: "Rolling resistance (0.0030–0.0050, lower = faster)"

Crank efficiency: "Power transfer efficiency (typically 96%)"

Explain briefly how these affect FTP modeling

Set smart defaults (only on onboarding / first-time setup):

CdA: 0.300

Crr: 0.0040

Crank efficiency: 0.96

Tire width: 28mm

Consider UX simplification:

Optionally hide advanced fields behind “Advanced settings” toggle

Keep first-time user experience non-intimidating

Simplify Dashboard:

Remove full Profile editing UI from Dashboard

Replace with compact “Key Profile Metrics” card

Display:

FTP (current modeled FTP)

Rider weight

CdA

Crr

Make card read-only

Add clear “Edit Profile” button linking to Profile Settings

Test full flow:

Complete onboarding as new user

Verify Profile Settings mirrors onboarding structure

Update profile → verify Dashboard key metrics update correctly

Confirm no impact on historical session determinism

Deliverable:
Profile Settings is the single, clean editing surface.
Onboarding and Profile Settings share consistent design.
Dashboard shows only key metrics (clean + professional).

Time estimate: 6–8 hours
Blockers: None

Validation:

 Profile Settings replaces editing in Dashboard
 Onboarding and Profile Settings look consistent
 Tooltips explain technical fields clearly
 Defaults applied only on first setup
 Dashboard shows clean key metrics card
 FTP displayed clearly and correctly
 No visual clutter
 No regression in session behavior

### **Day 5 - Saturday, Feb 15** 🟡
**Focus:** Remove duplicate API routes

**Tasks:**
1. Confirm which `strava_import_router` is current:
   - Check git history
   - Check which is imported in main app
   - Ask yourself: which was last modified?
2. Delete the duplicate file entirely
3. Remove `/api/sessions/list` from `sessions.py`
4. Update imports in main app if needed
5. Test all affected endpoints:
   - `/api/strava/sync`
   - `/api/strava/import/{rid}`
   - `/api/sessions/list/all`
6. Verify no regressions

**Deliverable:** Clean API, no duplicates  
**Time estimate:** 3-4 hours  
**Blockers:** Need to identify which file is current

**Validation:**
- [ ] Only one `strava_import_router` file exists
- [ ] `/api/sessions/list` only in `sessions_list_router.py`
- [ ] All imports work
- [ ] Strava sync still works
- [ ] No 404s or 500s

---

### **Day 6 - Sunday, Feb 16** 🟡
**Focus:** Consolidate meta generation + Buffer day

**Tasks:**
1. Create `server/utils/meta_generator.py`
2. Single function: `generate_sessions_meta(uid)`
3. Move meta logic from:
   - `sessions_list_router.py`
   - `sessions.py`
   - `strava_import_router.py`
4. Call explicitly after:
   - Analysis completes
   - Batch import finishes
5. Document: "Meta is cache, not SSOT"
6. Test: Delete meta file, regenerate, verify correct

**If done early:** Use buffer time for:
- Catch up on any incomplete tasks from Week 1
- Test end-to-end flow (signup → onboarding → profile)
- Fix bugs discovered

**Deliverable:** Clean meta generation logic  
**Time estimate:** 3-4 hours + buffer  
**Blockers:** None

**Validation:**
- [ ] Single source of meta generation
- [ ] Meta regenerates correctly

## 📅 Week 2: Analytics Features (Feb 18-24)

### **Day 7 - Tuesday, Feb 18** 🟡
**Focus:** Profile versioning verification

**Tasks:**
1. End-to-end test scenario:
   - Create test user
   - Set weight: 80kg
   - Import 1 ride
   - Verify ride in `result_<sid>.json` has weight: 80kg
2. Change weight to 75kg via Dashboard
3. Import another ride
4. Verify:
   - Old ride still has weight: 80kg
   - New ride has weight: 75kg
   - `profile_versions.jsonl` has both versions
5. Document test results
6. Fix any issues discovered

**Deliverable:** Profile versioning proven to work  
**Time estimate:** 3-4 hours  
**Blockers:** Profile Dashboard must work (Day 2-3)

**Validation:**
- [ ] Old rides unchanged after profile update
- [ ] New rides use new profile
- [ ] Version history exists in jsonl file
- [ ] Determinism maintained

---

### **Day 8 - Wednesday, Feb 19** 🟢
**Focus:** Import rides UX improvements

**Context:**
For Pioneer Beta, keep import simple: ONLY 10 or 50 rides.
- 50 rides: Recommended (needed for meaningful Power Profile + FTP Progression)
- 10 rides: Quick test option (for users who want to try before committing to full import)

**Tasks:**
1. ~~Add date range picker to import UI~~ (SKIP for Pioneer Beta - too complex)
2. Add "last N rides" option:
   - **Simple dropdown: 10 rides OR 50 rides ONLY**
   - Default: 50 rides (recommended for Power Profile)
   - 10 rides: Quick test option
   - Note: 50 rides needed for meaningful FTP Progression analysis
3. Show progress during import:
   - "Importing ride 5 of 50..."
   - Progress bar?
4. Better error handling:
   - Show which rides failed
   - Allow retry for failed rides
5. Test with both options (10 and 50 rides)

**Deliverable:** Import UX is simple and clear (10 or 50 rides only)  
**Time estimate:** 3-4 hours (simpler than original - no date picker)  
**Blockers:** None

**Validation:**
- [ ] Dropdown shows ONLY 10 or 50 rides (no other options)
- [ ] 50 rides is default/recommended
- [ ] Progress visible during import
- [ ] Errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Both 10 and 50 ride imports work
- [ ] UI explains: "50 rides recommended for full Power Profile"

---

### **Day 9-10 - Thursday-Friday, Feb 20-21** 🔴
**Focus:** Power Profile Analysis (BACKEND) - NEW FEATURE

**Context:** 
This is the #1 WOW feature - shows users their concrete form (FTP + peak efforts).
Must work regardless if user has 50 rides from 1 month or 2 years.

**Day 9 Tasks (Backend - Rust + Python):**
1. **Peak efforts calculation (Rust):**
   - Add function to find best watt for durations: 1min, 5min, 20min, 45min, 60min
   - Use sliding window algorithm over watt streams
   - Return: `{duration: watts}` for each ride
   
2. **Smart FTP calculation (Python):**
   - Collect peak efforts from all rides
   - Calculate FTP estimates:
     - From 5min: `best_5min * 0.85`
     - From 20min: `best_20min * 0.95`
     - From 45min: `best_45min * 0.98`
     - From 60min: `best_60min * 1.00`
   - Take highest estimate as FTP
   
3. **W/kg calculation:**
   - Get rider weight from `profile.json`
   - Calculate all metrics in W/kg as well
   
4. **Store in result files:**
   - Add to `result_<sid>.json`:
     - `ftp_watts`, `ftp_watts_per_kg`
     - `peak_1min`, `peak_5min`, `peak_20min`, `peak_60min` (both W and W/kg)

**Day 10 Tasks (API endpoint):**
5. Create `/api/analytics/power-profile` endpoint:
   - Input: user_id
   - Load all `result_<sid>.json` files
   - Extract peak efforts from each ride
   - Find overall bests (max across all rides)
   - Calculate FTP (current best)
   - Calculate progression (first ride FTP vs current)
   - Return JSON:
     ```json
     {
       "current_ftp_watts": 265,
       "current_ftp_wkg": 2.7,
       "first_ftp_watts": 250,
       "first_ftp_wkg": 2.5,
       "progression_watts": 15,
       "progression_percent": 6,
       "peak_efforts": {
         "1min": {"watts": 420, "wkg": 4.2},
         "5min": {"watts": 340, "wkg": 3.4},
         "20min": {"watts": 280, "wkg": 2.8},
         "60min": {"watts": 260, "wkg": 2.6}
       }
     }
     ```

6. Test with multiple user scenarios:
   - User with 50 rides from 2 months
   - User with 50 rides from 1 year
   - User with only 10 rides

**Deliverable:** Backend can calculate Power Profile  
**Time estimate:** 12 hours (2 days)  
**Blockers:** Need precision watt streams available

**Validation:**
- [ ] Peak efforts calculated correctly from watt streams
- [ ] FTP estimate is accurate (uses best of multiple durations)
- [ ] W/kg calculated correctly
- [ ] API returns consistent data
- [ ] Works with different ride count/timespan scenarios

---

### **Day 11-12 - Saturday-Sunday, Feb 22-23** 🔴
**Focus:** Power Analytics - Dashboard + Trends Page (FRONTEND) - NEW FEATURE

**Context:**
Analytics must be DYNAMIC and live in TWO places:
1. **Dashboard:** Key metrics (snapshot/summary)
2. **Trends Page:** Full Power Profile + FTP Progression (detailed view)

Both must update automatically when user imports new rides.

**ARCHITECTURE DECISION:**
- Analytics are computed ON-DEMAND (not cached)
- Every time user views Dashboard or Trends: fetch from `/api/analytics/*`
- Backend reads ALL `result_<sid>.json` files and calculates current metrics
- This ensures data is always fresh after new imports

**Day 11 Tasks (Dashboard Key Metrics):**
1. Create "Key Metrics" widget in Dashboard (top of page)
2. Fetch data from `/api/analytics/power-profile`
3. Display SUMMARY only:
   ```
   💪 CURRENT FTP: 265W (2.7 W/kg)
   📈 Progress: +15W (+6%) since start
   🔥 Best 5min: 340W (3.4 W/kg)
   
   [View Full Analysis →] (links to Trends page)
   ```
4. Keep it minimal - just enough to show progress

**Day 11 Tasks (Trends Page - Power Profile):**
5. Create NEW PAGE: `/trends` (add to navigation)
6. Section 1: "Power Profile"
7. Fetch data from `/api/analytics/power-profile`
8. Display FULL layout:
   ```
   🎯 YOUR POWER PROFILE
   
   💪 FTP: 265W (2.7 W/kg)
      First ride: 250W (2.5 W/kg)
      Improvement: +15W (+6%) 🔥
   
   📈 PEAK EFFORTS:
      1min:  420W (4.2 W/kg) - Sprint power
      5min:  340W (3.4 W/kg) - VO2max
      20min: 280W (2.8 W/kg) - Threshold
      60min: 260W (2.6 W/kg) - Endurance
   ```
9. Add tooltips:
   - FTP: "Functional Threshold Power - max watt you can sustain for ~1 hour"
   - W/kg: "Watts per kilogram - accounts for body weight"
   - Peak efforts: "Your best performances at different durations"

Day 12 – Physics Update + FTP Progression (Model Freeze Prep)

Primary Focus:

Improve physics model (Crr based on tire width)

Implement FTP Progression (backend + frontend)

Recalculate baseline before Polish & Testing

🔧 Part 1 – Physics Model Adjustment (Crr Update)

Goal: Improve accuracy before E2E freeze.

Tasks:

Add tire width selector in Profile:

25 mm

28 mm (default)

30–32 mm

Implement Crr mapping (performance road assumption):

25 mm → 0.0037

28 mm → 0.0034

30–32 mm → 0.0035

Keep fixed defaults:

CdA = 0.300

Crank efficiency = 0.96

Ensure:

Changing tire width updates Crr dynamically

Crr is not directly editable

Existing rides re-use stored result data unless explicitly recalculated

Re-import 50 test rides and verify:

Average power difference reasonable (few watts shift)

FTP change logical

No regression in analytics

Deliverable: Updated physics baseline locked before Week 3.

📈 Part 2 – FTP Progression Backend

Create endpoint:

/api/analytics/ftp-progression

Backend Logic:

Load all rides sorted by date

Calculate timespan (first → last ride)

If timespan > 6 months:

Use last 6 months only

Group by week (ISO week format YYYY-Wxx)

Calculate:

Weekly FTP (best estimate in that week)

W/kg (using profile weight snapshot)

Rides per week (average)

Compute:

Linear regression (watts per week trend)

Weeks analyzed

Generate projections:

+4 weeks

+8 weeks

+12 weeks

Return structure:
{
  "ftp_by_week": [
    {"week": "2025-W40", "ftp_watts": 250, "ftp_wkg": 2.5},
    {"week": "2025-W44", "ftp_watts": 258, "ftp_wkg": 2.6},
    {"week": "2026-W05", "ftp_watts": 265, "ftp_wkg": 2.7}
  ],
  "trend_watts_per_week": 1.9,
  "rides_per_week": 6.2,
  "weeks_analyzed": 12,
  "projections": {
    "4_weeks": {"watts": 273, "wkg": 2.73},
    "8_weeks": {"watts": 281, "wkg": 2.81},
    "12_weeks": {"watts": 289, "wkg": 2.89}
  },
  "confidence": "high"
}

📊 Part 3 – Trends Page Frontend

Under Power Profile, add:

Section 2: FTP Progression

Display:

Line chart (weeks on X-axis)

Weekly FTP (not ride numbers)

Rides per week:

“6.2 rides/week ✅ Great consistency!”

Trend:

“+1.9W per week”

Projections block:

🔮 IF YOU CONTINUE:
4 weeks:  273W (2.73 W/kg)
8 weeks:  281W (2.81 W/kg)
12 weeks: 289W (2.89 W/kg)


Activity messaging:
3+ rides/week → “Great consistency! 💪”
1–3 rides/week → “For faster gains: 3–4x per week”
<1 ride/week → “⚠️ Low activity – projection uncertain”
🧪 Validation Before Freeze

Crr updates when tire width changes
CdA and crank remain fixed defaults
FTP progression correct for:

50 rides / 1 month
50 rides / 1 year
10 rides only
 Projections reasonable (not explosive/unrealistic)
 No major performance slowdown
 Analytics update after new ride import

🎯 Outcome of Day 12
Physics model improved and frozen
FTP progression fully implemented
Baseline recalculated
Ready to enter Week 3 (Polish & Testing) with stable model

## 🚧 Risk Management

### **High-Risk Areas**

**1. Profile versioning might not work first try**
- Mitigation: Test early (Day 7)
- Fallback: Simpler approach (embed snapshot in result)

**2. Peak effort calculation might be computationally expensive**
- Mitigation: Cache results in `result_<sid>.json` (calculate once)
- Fallback: Limit to finding just FTP-relevant durations (20, 60min)

**3. Users with variable activity patterns (1 month vs 2 years)**
- Mitigation: Time-based grouping (weeks), not ride-based
- Fallback: Show warning if low activity (<1 ride/week)

**4. Strava API rate limits during batch import**
- Mitigation: Add delay between imports
- Fallback: Import in smaller batches

**5. FTP calculation might not match user expectations**
- Mitigation: Use multiple duration estimates, take best
- Fallback: Add "manual FTP override" in profile settings (future)

**6. Pioneer users might not have 50 rides available**
- Mitigation: Provide 10-ride option as alternative (though analytics less meaningful)
- Expectation setting: Onboarding guide emphasizes "50 rides recommended"
- Fallback: Analytics still work with fewer rides, but show warning about limited data

## 🔄 Adjustment Rules

**If falling behind:**
1. Re-prioritize: Cut 🟢 tasks first, then 🟡, never 🔴
2. Simplify: Reduce scope of features
   - Skip peak 1min/45min, just show 5/20/60
   - Skip projections, just show trend
3. Ask for help: Reach out if truly stuck
4. Extend deadline: Only if unavoidable (March 1 is soft deadline)

**If ahead of schedule:**
1. Add polish: Better UX, animations, styling on Power Profile
2. Add benchmarking: "Your FTP is in 'Good' category (2.5-3.5 W/kg)"
3. Pay more debt: Remove legacy routes, add tests
4. Prepare for April: Start thinking about goal-tracking feature

## 🚀 Post-Sprint (After March 1)

**Immediate next steps:**
1. Gather pioneer feedback on Power Profile + FTP Progression
2. Fix bugs reported
3. Plan April sprint (MVP launch)

**April sprint will add:**
- **Goal tracking** (build on FTP Progression - let users "lock" projections as goals)
- Intensity distribution (time in zones)
- Better trends (power curves, training load)
- Foundation for leaderboards (segment detection)
- Payment integration?

**Note:** Power Profile + FTP Progression are perfect foundation for goal tracking.
In April, just add: "Click projection to set as goal" → activate tracking.

## 💡 Key Changes from Original Plan

**REPLACED:**
- ❌ "Simple Trend Analysis" (generic watts/distance/elevation over time)
- ❌ "Simple Goals Feature" (manual goal setting + tracking)

**WITH:**
- ✅ **Power Profile** (FTP + peak efforts in W and W/kg)
- ✅ **FTP Progression** (time-based trend + future projections)

**Why this is better:**
1. **Higher ROI:** Concrete metrics (FTP, peaks) vs generic trends
2. **More motivating:** "You can reach 280W in 8 weeks" vs manual goal setting
3. **Simpler to implement:** No goal state management, no tracking UI
4. **Better foundation:** Can add goal tracking in April by building on progression
5. **WOW factor:** Users immediately see form + progress after importing 50 rides
6. **Works for all users:** FTP-chasers AND long-distance riders (like Jotunheimen case)

**Time estimate:**
- Original: 16-20 hours (8-10h trends + 8-10h goals)
- New: 20 hours (12h backend + 8h frontend)
- Same total effort, better outcome ✅
