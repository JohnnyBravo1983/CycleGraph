# 🧠 TECH DIFFERENTIATION – Why CycleGraph Stands Out

CycleGraph is not just another fitness tracking app. It is a data-driven, explainable, and high-performance analytics platform built for cyclists – with serious technology under the hood.

## 🚀 Core Technologies

### ✅ 1. SHACL for Explainable Rules
- Every insight is **based on declarative logic** – not hidden thresholds or black-box ML.
- Users understand *why* a ride is flagged as “not effective” or “out of range.”
- Future extension: let coaches or athletes define their own training constraints.

> Unlike most apps, **our logic is inspectable, customizable and auditable.**

---

### ✅ 2. RDF for Semantic Data Modeling
- RDF lets us model the real structure of training:
  - Sessions → Zones → Constraints → Athlete history
- This makes it easy to reason over:
  - Training monotony
  - Distribution of intensity over weeks
  - Progress patterns across years

> We treat your training as a **graph of knowledge**, not just CSV rows.

---

### ✅ 3. Rust Core for Performance
- Data analysis is done in **Rust**, giving speed, safety and parallelism.
- The Rust core is exposed to Python via `pyo3` bindings.
- This hybrid approach gives:
  - 🧠 Python flexibility for scripting, CLI and integration
  - ⚙️ Rust performance for heavy logic

> **You get developer velocity without sacrificing performance.**

## 💡 Why It Matters

| Feature | Typical Fitness App | CycleGraph |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| Rule explanation | ❌ Black box logic | ✅ Transparent via SHACL |
| Data model | ❌ Flat JSON | ✅ RDF graph |
| Performance | ❌ Python-only backend | ✅ Rust-accelerated core |
| Customization | ❌ Hardcoded metrics | ✅ Declarative rule engine |
| Scalability | ❌ UI-heavy apps | ✅ Modular CLI + API ready |

## 🧩 Competitive Advantage

CycleGraph is positioned in a niche few others occupy:
- Combines sports science with semantic tech
- Speaks both to athletes and data engineers
- Built to scale, yet easy to test and evolve

We're not building another app.
We're building a **semantic performance engine** for serious cyclists.
